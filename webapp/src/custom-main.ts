/**
 * An array that contains your application's custom providers.
 *
 * This array is intended to hold any custom providers that your application requires.
 * Providers are used in Angular to inject dependencies into components, services, and other parts of the application.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Add any custom providers that your application needs to this array.
 * - These providers will be available throughout the application for dependency injection.
 *
 * Important:
 * - @AutoSkip: Do not remove this tag to keep your file out of regeneration. This ensures that the file is not overwritten by the generator.
 * - @Note: This file is generated once and will no longer be erased by the generator. You can safely add your custom providers here without worrying about losing them during code generation.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * export const CUSTOM_APP_PROVIDERS = [
 *   { provide: SomeService, useClass: SomeServiceImpl },
 *   { provide: AnotherService, useClass: AnotherServiceImpl }
 * ];
 */
export const CUSTOM_APP_PROVIDERS = [];
